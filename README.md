# Senpais Trains

Hey Guys,

this is a combination of my two old MODs [Senpais Electric Trains](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/LuziferSenpai/SenpaisElectricTrains) and [Battle Trains](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/LuziferSenpai/Battle-Train-MOD)!

## The Trains and Wagons

## Automatic Coupling!

### How it works:
 - If you want to Couple you send the Coupling Signal
 - If you want to Uncouple you send the Uncoupling Signal with the Strength of how many you want to Uncouple.
 - Like in the GIF below it sends a Signal Strength of 10.
 - ITS NOT DESIGNED FOR SINGLE HEADED TRAINS!!!

## Simpler Smarter Trains!
 - You open the GUI and have a Train open.
 - Than you add a new Linie with the Schedule of the Train.
 - Than you assign a Signal to the Linie and to each Station on the Linie in the GUI.
 - Next when the Train arrives at a Station, it checks for Coupling Signals or/and if both Wires are connected.
 - When that is true, the Train will save the Station for it self, so it can read out the Signals when it leaves the Station.
 - Red Wire is for Schedule, Green Wire is for Station in that Schedule.

## Does it have a Config?

### Yes everything is fully Configurable!
